## Production Files

![](images/pcb.jpg)

To place an order for the Haori36-MX PCB:

- Use the Gerber files available in the [production/](production/) folder.
- The [BOM](production/BOM.csv) and [CPL](production/CPL.csv) files can optionally be used with a PCBA service â€”â€” especially if you'd prefer to avoid soldering small diodes or LEDs. ðŸ˜Š

All components (except the MCU) are soldered to the back (bottom) side of the board.

The complete PCB design project is available in the [kicad/](kicad/) folder.

## 3D Printable Files

Print the case and plate using the provided [STL files](case/).

## Firmware

Precompiled VIA-enabled firmware:

- Flash `penk_haori36_mx_default.uf2` under [firmware/](firmware/) to the RP2040 MCU.
- Load the [via.json](firmware/QMK/keyboards/penk/haori36_mx/via.json) file in the `Design` tab for [VIA](https://usevia.app) configuration.

The QMK source is available under [firmware/QMK/keyboards/penk/haori36_mx](firmware/QMK/keyboards/penk/haori36_mx/).

### Default Keymaps 

![layout](images/layout.jpg)

The keymap is based on Rico's [rsta layout](https://github.com/rstacruz/my_qmk_keymaps/blob/main/preview.png), and the custom keycaps are made by FK Keycaps. 

You can order the same keycap set or customize yours at [https://fkcaps.com/custom/D7829J](https://fkcaps.com/custom/D7829J).
